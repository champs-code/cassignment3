#  Experiment 3: Responsive Navigation Bar

## Description  
This project is about building a clean and responsive navigation bar for a website.  
The idea was to make a menu that looks good on big screens but also works smoothly on small screens like phones.  
The navbar has 4 main parts:  
- Home  
- Projects (with links to my GitHub projects)  
- Blog  
- Contact  
This makes it simple and easy for anyone to move around the website whether they’re on desktop or mobile.
